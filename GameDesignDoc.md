##Charizard Cave Game
###Player


The player will control flying [Charizard] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/8l5fw28fo4avdrl/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-21%20at%2010.20.16%20PM.png) that can move up or down to avoid obstacles.

###Objective
The objective of the game is to fly for as long as possible without hitting an enemy or the top or bottom of the cave. Charizard will eventually fly faster and faster, making things more difficult.

###Controls
The player plays the game by pressing and holding the spacebar down and letting it go (to have charizard go down and up) and by using the mouse to click buttons to start/pause/quit the game.

###Beginning the Game
The player has two options when the game opens (see below). They can click start to begin, but it will only start when they have typed in their name to the "enter name" field. Otherwise the game will prompt them to enter their name. The second option will come later (PA6). That is the high schores option, which they can click to see a list of names with high scores.

###Score
The score increases the longer the player stays alive without dying.

###Dying
The player has one life. The player dies when Charizard hits any kind of enemy or the top or bottom of the gave. 

###Immunity
One of the 5 objects are fireballs [Click to view] (http://mmii.info/icons/Koole321/pokemon_fireType.gif) - small flame balls that move randomly and are rare). If Charizard hits (eats) one of these, he will be invincible for 10 seconds (meaning he can hit any object or the top or bottom without dying).

###Cave Walls
The cave walls, the one nonmoving object drawn in the layout below, will be spikey on the top and bottom. If Charizard hits these walls by either sinking too far or flying too high, he will die.

###Enemies
There are three types of enemies:
####Feraligatr
[Click to view] (http://spriters-resource.com/ds/pokemonrangertol/sheet/29933) (he is the big blue dinosaur). Feraligatr sits on the bottom of the cave and will jump up at various times, while sometimes staying on the bottom of the cave.

####Wingull
[Click to view] (http://spriters-resource.com/ds/pokemonrangertol/wingull.png) (he is the smaller white bird). Wingull moves in a vertical line up and down the screen, from the top of the cave to the bottom, repeatedly.

####Gastly
[Click to view] (http://spriters-resource.com/ds/pokemonrangertol/gastlyhaunterngengar.png) (Gastly is the top purple ball of gas). Gastly moves around in the air of the cave in a completely random pattern, flying around to try and get charizard.



###Layout
The game's interface is drawn below. It is very straightforward.

Note: The game is similar to the "helicopter game", but with enemies, for reference.
